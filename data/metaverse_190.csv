It is a world where luxury brands promote and sell their products in a metaverse environment. Fashion influencers also use YouTube to give advice on styling and short content, and lead lifestyle changes. As a result, the values and sensibility of digital-based fashion are also changing. Therefore, this thesis researched related contents through Fashion YouTube. Fashion YouTube, which has the top 5 domestic subscribers and videos as of May 2021, was selected. I crawled their youtube data reviews with python. As a result of the analysis of the collected data with text-mining, past fashion discovered fashion and trends, but modern fashion further emphasized the philosophy and values of life based on their own lifestyles. Rather than changing fashion based on trends, fashion is a means of expressing individual values, emphasizing emotional details and expressing fashion changes. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data analysis; Digital fashion; NVIVO; Python; Text mining,,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115661926

First, through knowledge, then through social, and now through geo-spatial, AI (the foundation of the Metaverse) will connect all entities on Earth through digital means thereby creating a three-dimensional informational and experiential layer across the world dubbed the Metaverse. The Metaverse has four characteristics: augmented reality, lifelogging, mirror worlds, and virtual reality. From the standpoint of Christian cultural engagement, a contextual theology has yet to be developed. In the work that follows, the Metaverse is engaged through a combination of contextualization and wholemaking from the standpoint of posthumanism and mysticism. The study focuses on evolutionary wholemaking as identified by Teilhard/Delio, while being guided by Bevans¡¯ five (early) models of contextualization. The method of contextual wholemaking enables new ways of seeing, embracing, communing, complexifying, and creating within the four spheres of the Metaverse. After exploring the nature of the Metaverse in the first half of the paper, insights were gathered from the dialogue between contextual theology and culture and discussed in the second half of the paper. ? 2021 by the author.

Our study focused on identifying elements that may affect the user¡¯s social perception (similarity, familiarity, attraction, liking, and involvement) of customized virtual avatars engineered considering the user¡¯s facial characteristics. We evaluated the participant¡¯s subjective appraisal of avatars that embodied the participant¡¯s habitual facial expressions or facial appearance. Results indicated that participants felt that the avatar that embodied their habitual expressions was more similar to them than the avatar that did not. Furthermore, participants felt that the avatar that embodied their appearance was more familiar than the avatar that did not.

A common approach for getting two highly disparate systems to be interoperable, is through an agreed-upon protocol (e.g., via standardization) or by employing a common framework. The problem of integrating systems arises when many of these protocols/frameworks come into existence. Both, agreeing on protocols/frameworks and creating mappings between protocols takes time and effort. An interoperability solution must be scalable and should not require stakeholders to adapt to major changes in their system i.e., systems should not need to be re-engineered as other systems are added, removed or replaced in the integration. IPSME is introduced as a solution for integrating highly disparate systems. IPSME decouples the dependencies between interacting participants. Interoperability is achieved through dynamic translations, with integrations external to the systems being integrated, avoiding the need for agreed-upon protocols or frameworks. Scalability is achieved by not having a limitation on the number of messaging environments or the topological organization thereof. IPSME is minimally invasive and through a network effect reduces the overall complexity of integrating many systems to linear. IPSME has been evaluated and thus far been tested in three use cases. ? 2021 ACM.",architecture; evolution; heterogeneous; idempotence; integration; internet of things; interoperability; invocation; mapping; metaverse; publish/subscribe; scalability; system of systems; systems; virtual,Multimedia systems; Virtual reality; Disparate systems; Dynamic translation; Idempotent; Integrating systems; Minimally invasive; Network effects; Publish/subscribe messaging; Interoperability,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111781249

With the use of the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for audio features and learning and classification parts for commands and language identification, the speech module handles intermixed requests in English and Korean languages, giving corresponding feedback. Evaluation with test data showed high accuracy of pre-diction, having on average 95.7% and 99.6% on the F1-Score metric for command and language prediction, respectively.

The generalization of smartphones and the miniaturization and democratization of connected gadgets are leading to new uses and new expectations. In this article, we provide an AR application to the trending educational activity of escape games in order to diffuse AR to a large audience. As the application of an educational escape game, which is a good tool to improve the motivation and communication skills of students, requires considerable time for design, manufacturing, and operating, a numeric, mobile AR version is proposed here. For this purpose, an original paper-based version of the scenario is presented, principally turning around the Solvay process for a high school/college audience. In this scenario, the students are led to follow in the footsteps of a young Belgian physicist, Ernest Solvay. Through enigmas, participants discover a secret room containing Solvay's secrets in Brussels. Puzzles about the periodic table of elements, the CPK color code, chemical reaction balancing, the notion of molar mass, the Solvay process, or the philanthropic conferences organized by Solvay and the many other scientists involved are used to illustrate the chemical process discovered. This scenario and the Leblanc process scenario have been adapted to an AR experience with the open application Metaverse. Unlike conventional escape game or escape lab activities, our AR escape games can be easily diffused to large audience classrooms without the presence of any teacher being required and without any systematic preparation.

In this research, the perceptions of students from the upper-middle level of a private educational institution in Mexico are analyzed with respect to the implementation of augmented reality teaching strategies based on the Metaverse mobile application. The study was descriptive, based on the application of surveys. Data recovery was carried out using a digital questionnaire designed expressly. 192 first semester students who attended the Mathematics Fundamentals course in the August-December 2018 period participated. The results revealed that, in relation to the previous school year, improvements in the school approval index were achieved, that there is an affinity to use reality increased in the classroom and that the perception regarding changes in learning when using strategies mediated by these tools is favorable. Therefore, it is inferred that the application of augmented reality in the teaching of mathematics significantly favors student performance. ? 2020 Universidad de Sevilla.

These predictions overstate the empirical evidence for the effects of VR; ignore its technical limitations; take for granted highly speculative claims about the nature of consciousness; and, most fundamentally, lose sight of the continuities between VR and other representational media. This article argues against thinking of VR as a magical technology for creating seamless illusions. Instead it situates VR as an emerging medium within an evolving community that is beginning to develop the media conventions to support sustained interaction and immersion. The future of VR is not an inevitable and delusional metaverse but a medium of representation that will always require our active creation of belief. ?

A small experimental methodology was adopted alongside a current literature review. Three research questions were posited as follows: (1) What are the affordances of immersive media within education? (2) What are the barriers to immersive media in education? (3) How may immersive media be implemented? Affordances of immersive media include greater content customisation, increased creativity with less risk, promoting student interaction, enhanced motivation and engagement, and the chance for students to engage in extraordinary experiences. In 2020, many students around the world are staying home and studying in isolation, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this emergency context, mobile applications can offer interesting experiences that can make life and learning less difficult and more pleasant. The mobile web application Metaverse was used to exemplify in two different ways how immersive media can be appropriately used as a tool in a university level education setting. The first prototype was a short quiz on general knowledge about New Zealand, to help orient new international students. The second prototype was a quick poll to feel the pulse and understand the mood of students while at home and physically away from the campus and their lecturers. In summary, the authors present an updated review of this technology and present their own new examples of applications that serve additional purposes. ?

In this research by design study, the researcher will use higher-end virtual reality (VR) systems (Oculus Quest, Oculus VR LLC, Facebook Inc., Menlo Park, CA) in a digital, polysynchronous, collaborative virtual learning environment to conduct fully immersive teacher professional development sessions. This overall research by design model will allow the researcher to design, along with teacher participants, a teaching framework for using virtual reality in schools. This will be done by assessing and reassessing teacher progress over the eight immersive training sessions and documenting the possibilities offered by this new technology to create engaging, contextualized and authentic student experiences. The research will take place in the fall of 2020, whether schools are open for physically-present classes or not. The 16 research participants will be high-school teachers, representing each of the French First Language District school boards in Ontario, Canada.

Metaverses today, such as Second Life, are dull, lifeless, and stagnant because users can see and interact with only a tiny region around them, rather than a large and immersive world. Current metaverses impose this distance restriction on visibility and interaction in order to scale to large worlds, as the restriction avoids appreciable shared state in underlying distributed systems. We present the design and implementation of the Sirikata metaverse server. The Sirikata server scales to support large, complex worlds, even as it allows users to see and interact with the entire world. It achieves both goals simultaneously by leveraging properties of the real world and 3D environments in its core systems, such as a novel distributed data structure for virtual object queries based on visible size. We evaluate core services in isolation as well as part of the entire system, demonstrating that these novel designs do not sacrifice performance. Applications developed by Sirikata users support our claim that removing the distance restriction enables new, compelling applications that are infeasible in today's metaverses. ? 2012 by The USENIX Association.

Interestingly, virtual world property and revenue generation are understudied and the concept of ownership in the metaverse is distinct and more complex than in the real world. In this article, virtual user innovation and ownership are conceptualized in two layers: (1) the content, and (2) the virtual platform. In-depth case studies of virtual user innovators are used to understand the role of ownership ambiguity in relation to success in a virtual environment. The data consists of transcripts from courts (1279 pages), blogs, interviews and expert commentary regarding six virtual user innovators. The findings reveal that the separation of content and platform ownership and their inherent interdependencies are a source of ownership tensions posing significant challenges to entrepreneurs. Moreover, the virtual world business model favors the platform's ownership rights while undermining other kinds of competing ownership interests. The current structures around ownership rights and control seem detrimental for successful business creation, profitable technology development and long-term user innovation success. The implications for theory and the practical implications for virtual entrepreneurs are discussed. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ownership; Platform; Second life; User innovation; Virtual world,Virtual reality; Ownership; Platform; Second Life; User innovation; Virtual worlds; Interactive computer graphics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048310593

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) allow computers to work predictably but inscrutably. Central to the design of GUIs are visual metaphors that help users understand the function of interface elements. In 1992, as GUIs were supplanting command-based interfaces, Snow Crash was published. In it, Neal Stephenson offers a new take on the SF/cyberpunk conceit of ""cyberspace"" with ""the Metaverse, "" a VR world Stephenson claims was inspired by real-world GUI design principles. Yet in Stephenson's 1999 essay ""In the Beginning. was the Command Line, "" the author rails against metaphor-based interfaces, claiming such software separates users from total control of their systems, control that can only be achieved by learning computer code. Similarly, in Snow Crash, programming code itself is cast as magical, an analog to a pre-Babelian speech that can control human minds as if they are computers. While Stephenson's novel does show that GUIs can constrain what users can do with their computers-as well as articulate ideas about what computers are for-it does something else. Despite its attack on GUIs, Snow Crash sees the appeal of cyberspace visions as rooted in a human desire to interact with computers in a human way. The real ""magic"" of making computers mean something on a human level occurs through metaphor-based mental operations which long predate computers. ? 2018 S F - T H, Inc..

To resolve those problems, this article suggests a plan to deploy content services for visitors¡¯ museum experiences by combining beacons and HMDs.

They were predicted by many novelists as well as envisaged in blockbuster movies at the start of the computer era. Constructing the first shared virtual worlds began in the last decade of the twentieth century when the Internet became ubiquitous. Extensions of the hypertext mark-up language (HTML) to immersive 3D graphics were proposed by several vendors and research groups that eventually materialized into what we know now as Extensible 3D (X3D) and its predecessor Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML). Academia has capitalized on these new horizons for education by setting up virtual campuses in Active Worlds?online shared virtual worlds based on the Renderware rendering engine. Thousands of virtual citizens populated CyberTown?a 3D online community developed in VRML language and the Blaxxun collaborative platform. The beginning of the new Millennium saw a start to many new developments and paradigms ranging from massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) to serious networked gaming and simply living in virtual reality. New development tools, new businesses, and new psychological, ethical, and judicial problems had arrived. Second Life had a major impact on the field as the countries were opening their embassies there, and international corporations used to set up their offices for interviewing job applicants. For many years, Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. was exploring how useful their very own networked virtual world ¡°PlayStation Home¡± could be. However only a small fraction of the billions of Internet browsing users were involved in virtual 3D living?and these were mostly content creators. Virtual 3D cities were implemented in Google StreetView which brought together augmented reality (AR) and a global positioning system (GPS) in mobile devices. Internet gaming using AR has become a ¡°national sport¡± and the most popular leisure activity for young people in some countries. Tourists have become accustomed to utilizing AR and GPS navigation in the places they visit. All these new opportunities of ¡°being concurrently here and elsewhere¡± with mobile phones, just a click away, are encapsulated in Pok?mon Go. Its impact is analyzed.

The transatlantic transactions unfolded in IBM's virtual Green Data Center, where students and instructors engaged in critical discussions on their local community, IBM, the European Union, and the United States' sustainability practices. By analyzing students and instructors' virtual exchanges, chat medium, and reflective comments, three categories of culturally enacted tensions were identified. These contradictions pertained to (a) emerging intercultural communication, (b) assigned collaborative activities, and (c) the use of the Second Life Viewer as a communication tool. The study demonstrated that contradictions can be contingent on institutional, broader cultural and historical constructs, Internet-mediated tools, and the different linguistic and cultural values and expectations related to relationship building and interactional dynamics. The study highlighted the importance of acknowledging such structural tensions as affordances for teaching and learning. Further, the study emphasized the need to take into account the institutional, pedagogical, instructional, and broader cultural realisms that impose constraints on teaching practices and participation in social virtualities.

Its goal, at the crossroad of the creation of images and interactive technology, of virtual reality, neurophysiology and information and communication sciences, is to develop a device and a media scenario to support the hypothesis of a split state and to objectify the situation of bilocation [2]. Being present both here in front of the screen and over there, beyond the screen, which is shown by empirical studies of video games and by artists and metaverse explorers in Second Life. This type of state resonates in neurophysiology with the artificial ""Out-of-Body Experiences"" sensations produced with the aid of virtual reality equipment on healthy subjects. The production includes the development of a scientific experimental facility for physiological measurements and a public installation allowing someone to live a non-ordinary experience of split self. The common feature to both aspects of the project is based on the original idea of integrating video and 3D technology in order to experiment a situation of flight in mixed reality. The subject is literally invited to ""become an avatar"", indeed, he sees his own image, filmed from behind, inlaid into a synthetic world where he will be able to move freely and experiment different events.

This altered reality called the metaverse is dreamlike. If reality, the metaverse, and dreams are virtual illusions, the metaverse and dreams are real. This suggests that virtual realities may be analyzed according to Carl Jung's compensational dynamics of dream analysis. The objective of such analysis would be discovery of contextual (target group) meaning in unconscious dimensions. Such discovery could lead to the use of mediated biofeedback to engineer Earth-sustainable media content in order to promote coherent frequencies on correlated electro-magnetic scales. This chapter will emphasize the authenticity of research on the collective unconscious as projected into the metaverse. Based on fundamental correlations in structure, function, and purpose of dreams as defined by Carl Jung, drama-based video games can be understood as a genre that may serve as an unprecedented, interactive dream analog for purposes of cognitive research. ? 2016 by IGI Global.

Through the practice of avatar creation, distribution, embodiment and transformation, the artists aim to understand the processes of virtual corporeality constitution: to question the role of the body in virtual environment, its importance in engaging with the world and in self-expression, and explore its metaphorical aspects. The method used to implement this project is a shared creative process, in which multiple subjects come to be authors along different phases of the project.

They seem to accept buying search as well as experience products from the in-world channel.",Metaverse retailing; Retail channel adoption; Second Life; Social virtual worlds; Svw shopping motivations,Commerce; Electronic commerce; Information systems; Interactive computer graphics; Marketing; Sales; Social networking (online); Virtual reality; Metaverse retailing; Retail channel; Second Life; Shopping motivations; Social virtual worlds; Information management,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968817602

It correlated their eye blinking behavior with an emotional response to various problems that they were asked to discuss on behalf of their users. Three Japanese college students joined the project where they discussed a simple and difficult problem, respectively. Teachers proposed online (mathematical problems) for them. Each session was 10 minutes in length. During the classes, the number of eye blinks was recorded for each student by using special software. After completing the PBL classes, the students answered questionnaires. Then the results were analyzed. All of the results suggested that the difficult question would make students' feelings unstable and increase the number of eye blinks. Using this system, teachers could analyze students' responses well to achieve a better outcome of virtual PBL. ? 2015 The Authors.

Although studies concerning retailing and store design in SVWs are starting to emerge, only one thus far dealt specifically with virtual store atmospherics. While this previous study proved that atmospherics are applicable in virtual stores, it didn't actually specify the different elements making up these atmospheric factors, nor described how they are being used in SVW stores. The current paper comes to fill this gap by investigating the atmospherics in 27 virtual stores in Second Life (SL). By means of deductive content analysis, and building upon atmospheric classifications in traditional and online stores, the paper proposes a typology for virtual store atmospherics. The proposed typology can present a framework which can be used to further investigate the impact of specific virtual store atmospherics on in-world shopper behavior as well as on the performance of metaverse retailers and thus guide future research on metaverse retailing. The current study also has important managerial implications, not only to virtual world retailers, but also to retailers of the other channels who can learn about new ways to differentiate their in-store experience.",Atmospherics; Content analysis; Metaverse retailing; Second life; Store design,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940050446

The article begins with some theoretical reflections on the behaviour of the student when using a virtual platform by means of an avatar, and with our observations of how this doubling of identity is actually the greatest asset of virtual worlds when we intend to apply them to teaching (1. Introduction). Then we move on to present our goals and method of work (2. Aims and methodology) and to analyse the development of the virtual space or sim, setting out the teaching strategies that were employed in each of the islands we created, and which correspond to reading comprehension, listening comprehension and written expression (3. Metaverse design). In order to assess the language learning results, we also devised tests throughout the experiment, which were repeated one month later. The assessment shows that the process of language acquisition is positive (4. Results analysis). Finally, we demonstrate that the rise of virtual worlds has been backed up by psycholinguistic factors, but at the same time their applicability and sustainability depend on technical aspects and very especially on theoretical and pedagogical tenets which are still to be drawn up (5.

The focus is upon how such screen-based virtual three dimensional spaces may utilize text within a context that departs from the primary attribute with which writing has inherently been associated-namely the display of informational content. In such environments semantics may be displaced through the usage of text as a playful device, displayed as artifacts that are riddle-like configurations, or constructs that are meant to be understood through means other than straightforward reading; bringing about states of heightened engagement and 'play' through their manipulation or indeed simply by being immersed inside them. The awareness that providing a means for straightforward reading might not be an appropriate goal in this regard lead to a search for sources that would address a need for play, for personal readings and interpretations; in other words, text that is meant to be 'felt' as an artwork, rather than to be 'read' as informational content. ? 2014 SPIE.",3D; Art; Avatar; Concrete Poetry; Constrained Writing; Play; Text; Typography; Virtual Reality.; Virtual Worlds,Interactive computer graphics; Online systems; Semantics; Virtual reality; 3D; Art; Avatar; Play; Text; Typography; Virtual worlds; Three dimensional computer graphics,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901820752

While some of these features are found in 2D e-SQ others are unique to MR-SQ such as human contact, emotional expressiveness, virtual trial and fantasy products, in addition to the 3D platform features. Thus, the CVE/Metaverse context presents opportunities for retailers to enhance social experience, responsive service and creative co-production opportunities. The study provides a framework for guidance for retailers to improve service quality in 3D Metaverse stores, as well as for future research. ? 2013 Westburn Publishers Ltd.",avatars; Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs); critical incident technique (CIT); Metaverse retailing; Metaverses; MR-service quality; Second Life,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887918831

Therefore, further analysis of human-machine user interface is crucial for user interaction with manufacturing systems through remote control. That is the motivation for investigation on evaluation of the user interfaces for remote control of manufacturing systems within the above-mentioned framework. Preliminary results of the evaluation of two types of interfaces are presented in this paper. These two interfaces are distinctive in one particular presentational aspect, while all the remote controlling functionalities are equal for both. The results show that one user interface type clearly fares better than the other over a number of factors as graded by users. ?

The project wove together several concepts: these are Roy Ascott's tenets of 'distributed authorship' and 'participatory poesis', which were brought together with a term that was coined by Axel Bruns to describe novel collaborative electronic forms of creative output in which the roles of the 'user' and the 'producer' have become merged, manifesting as a novel type of online behaviour that the author defines as 'Produsage'.

I am particularly focused upon the way in which such virtually three dimensional environments may place the usage of text within a context that stands in contradiction to its traditional one by creating an unexpected novel purpose which takes a marked departure from the intrinsic attribute with which text has inherently been associated - namely the attribute of readability. In such environments readability, or indeed even legibility, may often be displaced through the usage of text and typography as a playful device, as artifacts which may manifest in puzzle-like configurations, or as visual structures the contents of which are meant to be understood through means other than straightforward reading, thus bringing about states of heightened engagement, wonder and 'play' through their manipulation or indeed simply by being immersed within the spaces which are brought about through their very agency. I also wish to expand upon this subject by talking about my own experiments with this material and will conclude by positing that further virtual dimensions can be instrumental in eliciting exciting alternative usages of text and typography which bring to the fore the allographic properties of text as an artistic/creative expressive media that may well bear further scrutiny and exploration. ? 2012 IEEE.",3D; Allographic; Deconstruction; Legibility; Metaverse; Play; Readability; Text; Typography; Virtual worlds,3D; Allographic; Deconstruction; Legibility; Metaverse; Play; Readability; Text; Typography; Virtual worlds; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Typesetting,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870687423

In stage one the chapter introduces related theories and previous studies in order to present the Metaverse features. In stage two, the author chooses two different design and interactive environments to compare with Metaverse, which are, a normal face to face environment and a regular distance environment. Then the author executes three experiments in these different environments. In stage three, the author analyzes the retrospective data of three experiments with qualitative analysis by undertaking contextual inquiries in order to structure cognitive and interactive models of three environments. Furthermore, the author also executes an in-depth interview to get the qualitative data of subjects' opinion. Finally, the affinity diagrams could be established with these models and the interview to provide knowledge of Metaverse for readers who research or develop social network environment. ? 2012, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898246968

An alternative to user tests is the model based testing using simulations. The simulations provide important feedback about application accessibility particularly when it is hard to involve the target users in the tests which is often the case for users with disabilities. In this paper we propose a methodology of providing the quickly and easily necessary data for the simulations. In particular we show how to annotate task models using application walkthroughs logs that is data obtained by recording the application usage. We create annotated task models, which together with the user models are suitable for simulation of application usage by virtual users with various disabilities. We present tools for recording and processing of the application walkthrough logs and tools for the interactive task model annotation. Finally, we provide actual examples of task model annotation on three scenarios involving the Second Life metaverse. ? 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Accessibility Evaluation; Task Models; User Centred Design and User Involvement,Accessibility evaluation; Model based testing; Potential applications; Second Life; Task models; User involvement; User models; User tests; Users with disabilities; Virtual users; Walkthroughs; Artificial intelligence; Computer simulation,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864819765

The paper argues that 'utopic' islands have historically provided a fictional domain of experimentation that has informed the constitution of 'real' state spaces. From the 16th to 20th centuries this took the form of an increasingly consolidated and 'global' endotopia: a world, exemplified by the 'political' map, full of state spaces constituted as interiors. More recently, islands have served a very different metaphoric function, being used to create and legitimise spaces of exteriority - 'xenospaces' such as the online worlds of the 'metaverse' and the arcane legal/financial spaces of offshore - which in combination constitute an emergent xenotopia. The 'philosopher's island' (Mackay, 2010), therefore, represents a complex and polyvalent spatial form that serves to continuously and expediently redefine the nature of social space. ? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Boundaries; Islands; Metaverse; Offshore; Social space; Spatiality; Utopia; Xenospace,historical perspective; island; philosophy; spatial cognition,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864026025

These applications, as highly inmersive and interactive 3D environments, have become very popular in social networks and games domains. The existence of a set of open platforms like OpenSim or OpenCobalt have played a major role in the popularization of this technology and they open new exciting research areas. One of these areas is behaviour analysis. In virtual world, the user (or avatar) can move and interact within an artificial world with a high degree of freedom. The movements and iterations of the avatar can be monitorized, and hence this information can be analysed to obtain interesting behavioural patterns. Usually, only the information related to the avatars conversations (textual chat logs) are directly available for processing. However, these open platforms allow to capture other kind of information like the exact position of an avatar in the VW, what they are looking at (eye-gazing) or which actions they perform inside these worlds. This paper studies how this information, can be extracted, processed and later used by clustering methods to detect behaviour or group formations in the world. To detect the behavioural patterns of the avatars considered, clustering techniques have been used. These techniques, using the correct data preprocessing and modelling, can be used to automatically detect hidden patterns from data.

It may be that the key to understanding the paradigm shift in the human perception of ""reality"" is directly related to dream dynamics and structure. Because drama-based video games are structurally analogous to dreams, they may be used as a cognitive research instrument for mapping the psychological dynamics f the paradigm shift. Perhaps the most comprehensive theory of dream dynamics was developed by Carl G. Jung who employed symbolic-metaphorical feedback methodology to evoke meaningful insight in patients. Because he observed that dreams have dramatic structure, Jung referred to dramatic structure as a reference point for analysis that could lead to meaningful insight on the part of a patient. [Jacoby, 1973] Jungian dream analysis based on the narrative-metaphorical structure of dreams has proven to ""heal"" patients suffering from various degrees of mental disorder. Jung's methodology is consistent with recent cognitive research [Lakoff, 2002 and 2008] and methodology for reframing the collective ""political"" mind.

It seeks to define syncretic, or hybridized agency, particularly in social mixed reality data transfer artworks. Recent developments in bridging relationships with digital representation of identity through mixed reality interfacing, have brought about the need for further analysis of these new post-biological, hybridized states of being that traverse traditional paradigms of biophysics. time and space, and artistic practice. Roy Ascott's interpretation of syncretism within digital networks may facilitate further understanding of multi-layered consciousness, both material and metaphysical, that are emerging from our engagement with such pervasive computational technologies and post-biological systems. Syncretism has traditionally been regarded as an attempt to harmonise and analogise [1] Citing recent examples of practical research outcomes, this paper will cite what Deleuze and Guattari have called deterritorialisation of the human body and its dispersion throughout multiple reality manifestations and how mixed reality data transfer might constitute a reterritorialising effect that creates a syncretic post-biological digital identity for the user [2]. ? 2011 IEEE.",Art; Cross-reality; Dual Reality; Media Art; Metaverse; Performing Arts; Post-humanism,Art; Cross-reality; Dual Reality; Media arts; Metaverse; Performing arts; Post-humanism; Augmented reality; Biological materials; Data transfer; Electronic document identification systems; Virtual reality,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83755174264

The term Metaverse was first introduced in Stephenson's Snow Crash (1992: 24). I define the Metaverse as a virtual embodied world. Usually associated with gaming, this world allows players to access a website and experience a virtual three-dimensional space where they can interact with others. The students in the story were enrolled in an online high school music technology course I taught in the spring term of 2009. Students and I scheduled synchronous meetings, and after logging into the text-based program Second Life on their computers, we were transported to a threedimensional virtual world for multiple users. The students had logged in from their homes and could listen, record, stream music, instant message, and talk via headsets and microphones as they maneuvered their virtual embodied representative, their avatar, on SIMPhonic Island. Students control their avatar's movements to walk, run, and even fly, meeting with other avatars to discuss creating their music, collaborating, and broadcasting. Second Life (SL) was launched in 2003 and is available for any user eighteen years of age or older. SIMPhonic Island is located on the Teen Grid of Second Life. The Teen Grid (TG) is an area in Second Life for any teen thirteen to seventeen years old. There are two types of Teen Grid-sponsored projects, public and private. Public projects are open to anyone age thirteen to seventeen who has created an account on the Teen Grid. These accounts are free. SIMPhonic Island, like many of the other education projects, is a private project. Information about the public Teen Grid can be found at http://teen.secondlife.com/. The course, titled Music in Cyberspace, is offered to high school students in a Midwest school district in the United States. The term cyberspace is ""conceptualized as a net, matrix, Metaverse and universally, as a place constructed out of information"" (Jordan 1999: 26). The course's premier objective is to create a musical identity in a virtual world. The examination of garage musicians working in and out of informal and formal music venues led me to speculate as to how we form musical identities and the importance of venue. Discovering the many resources available to students outside the walls of the school revealed some of the nature of these venues. How the groups interacted with no one in charge and the connections they made between experiences in and out of school were important to their music development. In my study of garage musicians (Jaffurs 2007), the participants credited their parents, school music teachers, and private music teachers as being a part of their success as musicians. Several of their parents, while not actively part of the rehearsals, were former garage musicians themselves; they purchased the equipment and owned the garage (their venue was actually a basement). Hargreaves and Marshall (2003: 263-274) stipulated that the extent of the control and the style and genre of music chosen are necessary for the creation of these contexts. An important characteristic of what could be described as a third arena of learning, or Hargreaves and Marshall's (2003: 266) term, ""third environment,"" is the ""extra learning"" that occurs outside of the formal venue. This extra learning is vital. It is self-motivated learning for learning's sake. Categorizing the differences between informal and formal venues on a continuum led the author to discover where these two may intersect and revealed an opportunity for a unique venue. What are the possibilities that a virtual venue, a place with no walls, offers? What could such a venue offer to music educators and their students? If the third environment, or borrowing from Heath, the ""third learning environment"" (2001: 10-17) is the venue outside of the school where extra learning occurs, then perhaps the virtual venue could be delineated within the third environment. Underpinning the importance of venue for musicians is the idea that many young performers of popular music identify themselves as musicians, not as students learning to become musicians (Green 2001). Popular forms of music play a central role in the lifestyle of most teenagers, and indeed constitute a ""'badge of identity' for many of them"" (Tarrant, North, and Hargreaves 2001: 565-581). Understanding how we perceive musical identity may give us a deeper understanding of the many facets of musicians. Additionally, a course that encourages and fosters the development of a musical identity in a virtual simulation, not school simulation, for ""out of school activities and roles"" (Regelski 2004: 15) may be highly motivating. Many music educators may understand the importance of developing the musical skills and achievements necessary to be a musician but may not have thought about the broader perspective, the musical identity that each student defines for themselves. ? 2011 by Indiana University Press All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895607827

The AVATAR project provides secondary school teachers with methodological and pedagogical tools to use virtual worlds as an innovative teaching tool that motivates and engages pupils and at the same time enhances their learning by incorporating a collaborative learning and a learning by doing approach. In parallel, the ST.ART represent an application of the teaching and learning methods in virtual worlds applied to the specific context of street art in the field of contemporary art.

New requirements and challenges are today met by the design of a new operational model which is enabled by an old technology (i.e. Virtualization), rather than the implementation of a new technology: Cloud Computing. Although CS is mainly fostering Cloud Computing solutions solely for specific fields, such as enterprise and transactional Web applications (e.g. Amazon EC 2 aws.amazon.com/ec2), this pervasive paradigm is generating a metaphor that enables to access and share software in the Internet as data in a way which is natural for human beings. It is in the opinion of this paper that CS should not ignore the empowerment brought by such a social media oriented Cloud approach. Supporting knowledge construction and social behaviour, individuals are actively engaged in envisioning a new participatory model for the future of cultural creation [12]. A structured approach to Virtualization is proposed as a mean of bringing insight into this new epistemic scenario. Two experiments dealing with Cloud Computing for Virtual heritage are shown as examples: NU.M.E. 2010 as a testing experience in a cultural Metaverse, which confirms the hypothesis of Cloud Computing as a novel paradigm for knowledge construction in the digital humanities; the CINECA MDC (""Museo della Citt?"")

Unique technology capabilities of metaverses have the potential to enhance the conduct of virtual projects, but little is known about virtual worlds in this context. Virtual project teams struggle in meeting stated project outcomes due to challenges related to communication, shared understanding, and coordination. One way to address these challenges is to consider the use of emerging technologies, such as metaverses, to minimize the impact on virtual project teams. Applying a theoretical foundation for virtual teams in metaverses that includes both technology capabilities and the social interaction that takes place in the metaverse environment, we conducted an empirical investigation of project teams in a virtual world setting. The study examined the interplay of communication, representation, interaction, and team process tools with behaviors that led to role clarity, shared understanding, and coordination. While each individual technology capability contributed to project execution and outcomes, much of the power of the environment emerged through the interplay of social behaviors and technology capabilities. The results have intriguing implications for how metaverse technology capabilities might provide new ways to address gaps in the current research and practice of virtual project management and virtual teams. ? 2011, Authors.

Avatar-based virtual world education is highly interactive and provides a rich experiential environment compared with textbook-based theory and traditional written assignments. Allowing students to experience the practical consequences of theoretically driven branding efforts and activities also enables a simulation of a complete branding experience through role playing. Quantitative and qualitative data collected at the end of the course reveal that Second Life offers a suitable means to facilitate students understanding of theoretical branding concepts and ability to apply the theoretical principles to real-life scenarios. The integration of a virtual world into academic curricula thus suggests a promising method to narrow the classroom gap between branding theory and practice. ? 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",branding; education; Second Life; virtual worlds,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958786774

Metaverse services is a collective term for services such as Augmented reality, Life logging, Mirror world, and Virtual world. Among them, Twitter, Google, iPhone, and Secondlife (T.G.I.S) are the most popular services/products these days. To measure the adoption of these product/services, the most commonly used are IP traffic and iPhone sales. Thus, in this study, we measured adoption by measuring changes in the IP traffic volume of Twitter.com,Maps.Google.com, Secondlife.com,and sales for iPhone during a 2-year period (from the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009). To analyze this time series data to reveal the innovation and imitation effect, we employed the Bass model. The results showed that each of these services yields different innovation and imitation coefficient values. Imitation effects for all Metaverse services are greater than innovation effects, and Secondlife's innovation effects are larger than others. Also, iPhone sales, as a measurement for information and communication technology (ICT) products, showed greater innovation effects than the other services. Implications are drawn to explain these differences, such as, Googlemap's imitation effects are based on network externalities, while Twitter's imitation effects are caused by the interactions of individuals; iPhone sales' innovation effects are explained by the timing of the measurement. ? 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Bass model; Imitation; Innovation; iPhone; Metaverse; Service adoption,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958219627

Recent developments in bridging autonomous relationships with digital representation through mixed reality interfacing, have brought about the need for further analysis of these new 'post-biological', hybridized states of being that traverse traditional paradigms of time and space.

Asia-Pacific figurations, notably expatriate Chinese enclaves, are pronounced in popular images of urban settings, especially when dystopic. Children of Men (2006) renders a future London choked with snarling rickshaws, immigrants, traffic jams, and insurgents. This is a world of overcrowding, decay, and abrupt violence. Illegal immigrants are called "" fugees"" (refugees), though faces onscreen are so often Asian, that we might hear "" Fuji,"" the mountain sacred to the Japanese. A wellspring of Asian-inflected futurism is Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), adapted from Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and endlessly pilfered. "" Since Blade Runner's release, its techno-noir has been replayed in countless films, computer games, novels and other cultural objects,"" writes Lev Manovich.1 Philip K. Dick, Ridley Scott, J. G. Ballard, William Gibson, Neil Stephenson, The Matrix films, Otomo Katsuhiro (Akira), Iwai Shunji (Swallowtail; All About Lily Chou Chou), and Oshii Mamoru (Ghost in the Shell) are examples that conjure many myths of Chinatown. Tropes of inscrutability, superstition, enigmatic codes, and dissipation underwrite layers of condensed, collaged mediation. Imaginary Chinatown spaces are appropriated to model claustrophobic hyper-realities. This involves colonial thinking, with authorities trying to "" manage"" rising immigration from outside (yellow peril), as well as projections of "" escape,"" dreams of settlement into future, final frontiers. How do these tropes carry fantasies of global migration, multiculturalism, high-density habitats and hives of displacement, alienation? Analysis of relevant texts would examine signage, Chinese ideograms, and perhaps their appropriation by such Western theorists as Sergei Eisenstein, Bertolt Brecht, and Roland Barthes.2 The niceties of guanxi, feng shui, histories of opium and vice trade, varieties of overseas tongs, triads, martial arts and benevolence associations, with their competing dialects, politics, cuisines, and patron saints - all constitute vivid microcosms of ethnic display and articulation. We could trace such elements within popular stories, comics, and films, circulating within Asia as well as the West. But rarely are these primary, a subject, rather than stock backgrounds through which jaded white heroes gather clues and chase villains. In the science fiction novel Snow Crash (1992), Neil Stephenson cheekily presents Hiro Protagonist, a half-Korean super-hacker with a gift for Japanese swordsmanship. This character, with teenage sidekick YT ("" whitey"" ), roams a world of ethnically organized "" burbclaves,"" franchised gated communities, but spends most of his time manipulating information in the virtual Metaverse, an extrapolation of our Internet. Snow Crash is ingenious, vertiginous and wacky as Hollywood science fiction a la Brazil (1985), Max Headroom (1987), and The Fifth Element (1997). Still, why is this techno-Chinatown imagery so extraordinarily persistent? Verisimilitude, perhaps: highly condensed layering, the abrasive striations of economic and cultural congestion in many contemporary cities. This sedimenting process will continue and intensify, despite the rise of terror-related paranoia, xenophobia, and segregation. Asian diasporas' experience of settlement in often hostile surroundings lends compelling, persistent models of multicultural survival and secular co-existence. As signs of Asian mobility, migration, and habitation, fictional worlds still evoke the seedy, confined lanes of "" Chinatown,"" signifying varieties of unbridled technological hypermodernity. Using two animated films, my essay offers reflections on these models and signs, and theorizes contemporary ethnicities related to Chinatown. It proceeds by means of information technology, links with folklore, and finally a figure of premodern automata in Asia, the "" karakuri."" All these help visualize ethnic relations in tandem with historical and technological movements. This is why my title is doubly marked: bracketing Chinese, acknowledging techno-ethnicities' contingency (alternatives, such as Jewish, Hispanic, or African American). Yet it also signals the strong pull of technologized East Asia. As noted in this volume's introduction, we find here forces that are alternately charismatic and repellent. Hollywood and pulp science fiction are not the only places where we find Chinatown. In Japanese anime, there are well-known cyberpunk stories such as Ghost in the Shell employing spirit imagery as premonition of future states. Oshii Mamoru's animated films Ghost in the Shell (1995) and sequel Innocence (2004) raise issues pertinent to my theme of technology and Chinese ethnicity. The first is the reversible interface of subject and mediatized surroundings; the second concerns re-mediation, or the relations between old and new media along the winding march of progress. In Oshii's animations, a post-photographic world is dress rehearsal for ethnic transmutations. Ethnicity, like gender, body, and space itself, is exchangeable, fundamentally refigured in new media forms. But these forms may be archaic. Chinatown feels familiar in these animated environments, yet it pushes toward defamiliarized, alien, life-like zones of informational identity. Prompted by Oshii's animation, we can rethink ethnicity as remediated or produced through technology, rather than reproduced from profilmic origins. ? 2010 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

The increasing capabilities of internet and the ever increasing dependence of business entities on internet have led to the development of metaverses - internet-based 3D virtual worlds - which act as business platforms where companies display and showcase their latest products and services. This is in turn has led to a demand for development of methods for the easy transfer of data from stand alone PLM systems to the internet based virtual worlds. This paper presents the development of a translator which will transfer product data of 3D models created in CAD systems to an internet based virtual world. This translator uses a faceted-surface approach to transfer the product information. In this work CAD models were converted to a CAD-neutral data format, JT file format, and finally recreated in the metaverse Second Life (SL). Examples of models translated from JT to SL have been presented. A technique known as prim optimization, which increases the efficiency of the translation was also incorporated in the algorithm for the translator. Examples of prim optimization have been provided in the paper.

Thus five avatars, of both sexes, human as well as non-human, have pooled their resources in the operation of a design enterprise, within which each virtual identity pursues his/her own line of creative inquiry, culminating in different lines of output.

Metaverses such as Second Life are a relatively new type of Internet application. Their functionality is similar to that offered by 3D multi-player online games, but differs in that users are able to construct the environment that avatars inhabit and are not constrained by predefined goals of the type found within a game environment. From a quality of service (QoS) perspective metaverses are similar to games in that the timeliness of network communication is important, but differ in that their demands upon host server systems and network traffic are more bandwidth intensive. This paper contributes to our understanding of metaverses by presenting a case study of the application of Game Based Learning (GBL) within a metaverse environment, by situating the case study within a survey of the state of the art in GBL in metaverses and by analysing the QoS delivered by the widely used Second Life metaverse under a range of evaluator-induced network conditions. ? 2010 IEEE.",Archeology; Game based learning; Learning technologies; Metaverse; Multi user virtual environment; MUVE; Second life; Virtual excavation; Virtual worlds,Game-based Learning; Learning technology; Metaverse; Multi-user virtual environment; Second Life; Virtual worlds; Excavation; Quality of service; Telecommunication systems; Virtual reality; Arts computing,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954343443

One concept that stems from and combines these two motives is 'metaverse', 3-D user-created virtual worlds. During the last few years, we have witnessed the rise of several metaverse attempts, and a growing art community within them, due to the possibilities they offer for building creative content. This paper develops from the historical evolution of metaverse, and the dynamic and transformative relationship between art and information and communication technologies (ICT), which has so far transformed the spectator into participator, user, and even creator of both the artwork and content in the web. It discusses and further proposes a form of 'meta-art', the native art form of a future metaverse, which inherits this transformative interplay between art and ICT and already existing art expressions in the current metaversal worlds. ? 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Art; Collaboration; Interconnectedness; Metaverse; Openness; Temporality; User-created content; Virtual worlds,Art; Collaboration; Interconnectedness; Metaverse; Openness; Temporality; User-created content; Virtual worlds; Information technology; Virtual reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954482853

In particular we analyse the relationships between application functionality, SL's traffic control system and the wider network environment. Two sets of studies have been carried out: one of the traffic generated by a hands-on workshop which used SL; and a follow up set of controlled experiments to clarify some of the findings from the first study. The interplay between network latency, SL's traffic throttle settings, avatar density, and the errors in the client's estimation of avatar positions are demonstrated. These insights are of particular interest to those designing traffic management schemes for metaverses and help explain some of the oddities in the current user experience.

This research examines the different uses of LBSs based on a virtual environment. It is argued that using the real world method of developing and deploying LBS restricts the types of uses being developed and that an alternative approach might yield insight into what types of uses are possible and how it might change the thinking of LBSs developers. This research surveyed the Second Life metaverse to identify and categorise the types of LBS used and deployed in the digital world. The results of the survey found that many of the LBSs in SL provided intelligence to the avatar so that they could perform an action which they could not do without the LBS. It is clear that the topic of navigation is biased based on the digital nature of the SL metaverse and its use of the teleportation concept. But the results show that LBSs are ubiquitous throughout metaverse and the types of services go beyond those found in the real world. ? 2010 Taylor & Francis.,Location-based service use; Metaverse; Virtual reality,Alternative approach; Current trends; Digital world; Location-based service use; Location-Based Services; Second Life; Virtual environments; Knowledge based systems; Research; Surveys; Telecommunication services; Virtual reality; Encoding (symbols),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952524560

Virtual Worlds based on the relatively new open-source and free-to-install ""OpenSimulator"" software currently lack such a virtual currency framework, in particular one that can be used across the boundaries of such virtual worlds (also known as grids). In this paper we present the design of such a micropayment system for this class of virtual worlds. The functionality expected by the users of such a 3D environment is somewhat different from what is usually expected from Web payment systems. A particular challenge is the fact that parts of the software that our system is to be integrated with cannot be trusted, as they are run by unknown parties, and can easily be modified (as it is open-source software). Transaction values in such a virtual environment are usually very small, so the cost of a transaction is also of concern. The system has already been implemented and is used by a number of such virtual worlds. ? 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",3D Virtual Worlds; Hypergrid; Micropayment; Open Metaverse; OpenSimulator; Virtual Currency,Electronic commerce; Three dimensional; 3d virtual worlds; Hypergrid; Micropayments; Open Metaverse; OpenSimulator; Virtual currency; Virtual reality,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957062552

On the one hand, the website (providing new residents with survival tips in three languages) has attracted hits from all over the globe. Also, sales of one transportation device show potential for significant profit. On the other hand, a similar transportation device has been ignored by the residents, as has the image enhancer.

Particular emphasis is paid to key promotional aspects and we highlight the key challenges and opportunities faced by traditional retailers, e-retailers and metaverse retailers. For the metaverse phenomenon, the authors analyse Second Life and a range of findings emerge. One key finding is that retailers need to employ a holistic and overarching approach when devising their promotional strategies, especially if they aim to operate at the metaverse stage as well.

These contemporary computer technologies provide a new showcase for cultural promotion and creative production, as they connect artists and producers with an audience around the world, who, in turn, can access in real time a great variety of cultural content through just a few clicks. The various features of this emerging phenomenon all help to democratize culture, the arts and education, as they bring creations closer to consumers, thus reducing the need for intermediaries and breaking down social, economic and political barriers; this offers benefits to cultural industries, non-profit organizations, governments, collective and individual creators and artists. However, the numerous possibilities ushered in over the last few years not only bring benefits but also pose new challenges in terms of regulation. Indeed, this new stage for cultural and artistic expression and management may require new paradigms of control with a different focus, ones which can provide an alternative understanding of online cultural exchange in real time. Virtual worlds make culture more democratic, as it can be reached for free by a wider range of people in real time; furthermore, artists and creators are provided with an accessible showcase in which they can become better known and where they can interact more directly, immediately and closely with their audience. The possibility and ease with which anyone can create original content in the metaverse is an incentive for creativity, because it allows people to express themselves in original ways that enhance the contents of virtual life. Art thus finds new and different formats, and cultural management discovers new spaces to break into. At the same time, anonymity, privacy and intellectual property are all issues that need to be addressed. The regulation of virtual worlds may require different ways of thinking and the adoption of new paradigms which consider exchange, democratization, cooperation and sharing as essential ingredients of these new sets; as such, any rules must control but not restrict, thus avoiding anarchy at the same time as keeping interaction levels high. In the European Year of Creativity and Innovation it is important to consider the opportunities being opened up by these new technologies in the world of culture and education, as well as the possibilities that are emerging and which remain to be researched.",Creativity; Cultural management; Fair use; Regulation; Virtual art; Virtual worlds,Interactive computer graphics; Knowledge management; Social networking (online); Virtual reality; Creativity; Cultural management; Fair use; Regulation; Virtual art; Virtual worlds; Just in time production,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938579367

However, many of them such as the AOL - Time Warner, merger destroy shareholder value instead of increasing it. Mirivis (1992) and Vansina (1992) observe that approximately half of all company mergers fail at some stage of the integration process with the blame generally going towards the inability to reconcile two different organizational cultures. Dealing with the human elements of a merger there is often a lack of understanding on how to integrate organizational cultures of the existing firms. Not only is the concept of organizational culture one that is hard to tackle due to its vague and subtle meaning, but also an issue which is hard to manage due to the large amount of resources often required when dealing with human issues. While attempts have been made in the past to manage culture, they have been notoriously difficult to execute. However, innovations in information technology have provided new opportunities for employee training and education which go beyond the traditional seminar and discussion such as employing low-cost simulations using virtual worlds as a platform for communication and interaction. Using a qualitative approach based on the interpretation of previous research, elements from a variety of subject areas will be investigated in order to suggest an outline for the creation of a prototype application. Looking first at the composition of organizational culture and its manageability, an attempt was made to analyze culture to the extent that key dimensions can be identified. Due the difficulty of tackling the culture problem as a whole, it has been tackled by targeting cultural dimensions by drawing upon experiences and learning objectives from existing serious games, commercial and educational, in order to identify the necessary specifications for establishing a simulation aimed at changing organizational culture. Consequently, an attempt will be made to enhance elements borrowed from traditional games into one simulation using key elements in behavior modification and drawing upon theories in education and learning, to achieve an ultimate goal of providing the outline for an innovative prototype scenario for SME and large organizations, capable of dealing with the culture problem in mergers and acquisitions. At current stage, virtual worlds and metaverses not only provide the ideal learning environments for tackling a group problems such as culture, but also they potentially do allow for the creation of complex extensive games. If one takes some of the key components of organizational culture and compares them to the learning objectives of some traditional games, it can be established that the ideal simulation needed to tackle the problem of culture within organizations, consists of a mixture of processes, random events, role-play and adaptable reward structures, conditioning and ultimately a complex emulation of reality.",Metaverse; Organizational culture; Serious game; Virtual world,Computer aided instruction; Interactive computer graphics; Merging; Personnel training; Shareholders; Virtual reality; Behavior modifications; Communication and interaction; Learning environments; Metaverse; Organizational cultures; Qualitative approach; Serious games; Virtual worlds; Mergers and acquisitions,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938577697

These environments have potential for richer, more engaging collaboration, but their capabilities have yet to be examined in depth. Of particular interest in this paper is the use of metaverses for virtual team collaboration. We develop a conceptual model for research in metaverses that is based on five key constructs: (1) the metaverse itself, (2) people/avatars, (3) metaverse technology capabilities, (4) behaviors, and (5) outcomes. We present an indepth characterization of metaverse technology capabilities from a socio-technical view that recognizes the potential for variation in emergent interaction and in outcomes.

Some online virtual worlds have a dedicated purpose, such as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG), while others implement more of foundational frameworks which are not necessarily applications per se, but form platforms to create applications. One of the premier examples of the latter is Second Life from Linden Lab. While such networked virtual environments show great potential for interesting and novel applications, many technical challenges remain. A significant shortcoming in current systems concerns the communication between virtual world participants. Early designs only supported text chat, while more recently voice chat has been introduced. However, often the voice communication paradigm still mimics traditional audio group conferencing without adaptation to the three-dimensional metaverse paradigm. In this study we present our design of an interactive audio streaming protocol that aims to enable the creation of an aural soundscape around the user that matches the visual experience. To make our design practical, scalable and to avoid further burdening the virtual world servers, our protocol is based on a peer-to-peer distribution topology. Simulation results are presented that show the feasibility and utility of our design.

The term now refers to Web sites or services that weave data from different sources into a new data source or service. Using a musical metaphor that builds on the origin of the word 'mashup', this paper presents a demonstration ""playlist"" of four geo-mashup vignettes that make use of a range of Web 2.0, Semantic Web, and 3-D Internet methods, with outputs/ end-user interfaces spanning the flat Web (two-dimensional - 2-D maps), a three-dimensional - 3-D mirror world (Google Earth) and a 3-D virtual world (Second Life?). The four geo-mashup ""songs"" in this ""playlist"" are: 'Web 2.0 and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for infectious disease surveillance', 'Web 2.0 and GIS for molecular epidemiology', 'Semantic Web for GIS mashup', and 'From Yahoo! Pipes to 3-D, avatar-inhabited geo-mashups'. It is hoped that this showcase of examples and ideas, and the pointers we are providing to the many online tools that are freely available today for creating, sharing and reusing geo-mashups with minimal or no coding, will ultimately spark the imagination of many public health practitioners and stimulate them to start exploring the use of these methods and tools in their day-to-day practice. The paper also discusses how today's Web is rapidly evolving into a much more intensely immersive, mixed-reality and ubiquitous socio-experiential Metaverse that is heavily interconnected through various kinds of user-created mashups. ? 2008 Boulos et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,article; communicable disease; computer program; geographic information system; health survey; human; Internet; methodology; public health; Communicable Diseases; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Internet; Population Surveillance; Public Health; Software Design,Editorial,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48749120108

As virtual worlds and the World Wide Web generally, are global in scope, reach and use, Gewirth's theory, which offers a supreme principle of morality, the Principle of Generic Consistency (PGC) that establishes universal rights for all persons always and everywhere, is particularly suitable for this task. The paper will show that persons both in the real world and in virtual worlds have rights to freedom and wellbeing. Strictly with regard to agency those rights are merely prima facie but with regard to personhood framed around the notion of self-respect those rights are absolute. The third and final part of the paper will examine in more practical detail and application why and how designers, administrators and avatars of virtual worlds are rationally committed on the basis of their own intrinsic purposive agency to ethical norms of conduct that require the universal respect of the rights of freedom and well-being of all agents, including their own. Using Alan Gewirth's argument for the Principle of Generic Consistency (Reason and Morality, 1978) and my expanded argument for the PGC in my Ethics Within Reason: A Neo-Gewirthian Approach (2006), the paper will specifically seek to demonstrate that insofar as avatars can be viewed as virtual representations or modes of presentations of real people (at least with regard to some virtual worlds in which the virtual agency of the avatar can be considered an extension of the agency of the person instantiating the avatar in the real world) and thus can and must be perceived as virtual purposive agents, then they have moral rights and obligations similar to those of their real counterparts. Finally, the paper will show how the rules of virtual worlds as instantiated by the designers' code and the administrators' end-user license agreement (EULA), must always be consistent with and comply with the requirements of universal morality as established on the basis of the PGC. When the two come into conflict, the PGC, as the supreme principle of morality, is always overriding. ? 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

This approach enables users to visualise, interact with, and even walk or fly through, the plotted data in 3-D. Users can also do the reverse: put pins on a map in the virtual world, and then view the data points on the Web in Google Maps or Google Earth. The technologies presented thus serve as a bridge between mirror worlds like Google Earth and virtual worlds like Second Life. We explore the geo-data display potential of virtual worlds and their likely convergence with mirror worlds in the context of the future 3-D Internet or Metaverse, and reflect on the potential of such technologies and their future possibilities, e.g. their use to develop emergency/public health virtual situation rooms to effectively manage emergencies and disasters in real time.

Like the travellers of the earlier centuries who returned with information and curiosities from distant and previously undiscovered lands we bring back with us our narratives, our stories and descriptions of our experience of embodiment in these new landscapes. We find that inhabiting the spaces of these virtual worlds is challenging our relationship to our own. We explore, through the construction of digital narratives, the experience and journey of Wanderingfictions in her metaverse, Second Life and Dongdong¡¯s trans-national travel in the physical world exploring the Web 2.0 environment as metadata to articulate the user¡¯s virtual identity. Data was collected in the form of narrative; each took their turn to write from their world; like a collection of postcards or snapshots of experience. Through the emerging dialogue we discover a combination of dis-ease, fear, but also wonderment of this new shift, this new view, where we are able to live in and embody multiple realities. Exploring these various conditions challenges us to investigate our physical availabilities as travellers in these virtual environments. A non-human body as metadata offers us resources for thinking in more sophisticated ways about virtual technologies. User Generated Contents and 3D Virtual Worlds such as Second Life bring new forms of participation. These two main waves on the net are contributing to the systems of informatics in their structures, behaviours and interactions of digital knowledge and narrative. The narrative reveals the complexities of dealing with identity politics in the environments of virtual spaces. It observes how our early, though rapidly changing, sensibilities are responding. We are in transition. This article finds that we will only truly become post-human when our memory of being ¡®only human¡¯ finally fades. ? 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Cost, infrastructure requirements, and maintenance are all obstacles to the widespread deployment of immersive displays. We address these issues in the design and implementation of the Metaverse. The Metaverse system focuses on a multiprojector scalable display framework that supports automatic detection of devices as they are added/removed from the display environment. Multiple cameras support calibration over wide fields of view for immersive applications with little or no input from the user. The approach is demonstrated on a 24-projector display environment that can be scaled on the fly, reconfigured, and redeployed according to user needs. Using our method, subpixel calibration is possible with little or no user input. Because little effort is required by the user to either install or reconfigure the projectors, rapid deployment of large, immersive displays in somewhat unconstrained environments is feasible. ? 2005 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645750485

Box 2320, Fallbrook, CA  92028, United States","Metamodels are playing an increasingly important role in the specification of distributed object and component architectures, such as CORBA, CORBA Component Model, Enterprise JavaBeans and DCOM/COM+. By recursively abstracting the details associated with implementation, metamodels improve rigor and facilitate system integration and interoperability. The uses of metamodels range from specifying modeling languages and metadata repositories to defining data interchange formats and software processes (methods). The OMG Unified Modeling Language (UML) has proven an effective and popular choice for specifying metamodels. The OMG is using the UML to specify a comprehensive metadata architecture that includes metamodels (UML, Meta Object Facility, Common Warehouse Metamodel) and an XML-based metadata interchange format (XMI). Many other organizations are also using the UML to specify metamodels, such as the Meta Data Coalition's Open Information Model. Despite these successful applications of UML metamodels, many modelers still struggle with the relationships between models and metamodels, especially when they are specifying multiple-layer or multiple-viewpoint metamodel architectures, or when they are defining UML profiles or other language extensions. Metamodeling is still a nascent technique, and there is a lack of consensus regarding when and how it should be applied. ?

Creating VRML[1] documents, however, is complicated by its three-dimensional nature. VRML can be generated from existing 3D graphics editors or new applications can be written specifically for constructing VRML scenes. In this paper, we briefly introduce a prototype interpreted language called IVL (originally developed as a general Open Inventor[15, 16] prototyping language) that allows VRML models and scenes to be interactively developed and manipulated with simple English-like descriptions. IVL uses public domain code and can run on a wide variety of platforms - any platform supporting C++ and Open Inventor. As a demonstration of an application of this language, we describe work on the development of a 'metaverse'[14] - an interactive, multiuser, networked 3D world.",,C (programming language); Computer networks; Computer simulation; Computer simulation languages; Graphical user interfaces; Interactive computer graphics; Network protocols; Rapid prototyping; Three dimensional computer graphics; Prototype interpreted language; Virtual reality modeling language; Virtual reality,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029458278
